Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on DS-pad. A web based text editor. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about web development . 
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on DS-pad only because that is the only project that I am working on ;)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me --> deadshadow12119@gmail.com
